# Poll Analyzer  
In this project, we designed and implemented a Poll Analysis System for analyzing poll results of Zoom, by using Python.  
This project was implemented in 2 time-boxed iterations of 2 weeks which included all of the software development activities, namely, analysis, design, coding, and testing.  
This program takes some poll reports of students in a class and gives statistics about each student's results and their attendance, and a global file that includes everything.
